Except to the extent you and Unity have executed a separate agreement, these terms and conditions exclusively govern your access to and use of the Software, Developer Services, Communities and Site (collectively, the “Services”), and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Unity (the “Terms”).  These Terms, including all Additional Terms referenced in Section 1.3 below, are, collectively, the “Agreement.”

If you accept or agree to the Agreement on behalf of a company, organization or other legal entity (a “Legal Entity”), you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that Legal Entity to the Agreement and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.

You acknowledge and agree that, by accessing, purchasing or using the services, you are indicating that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by the agreement whether or not you have created a unity account, subscribed to the unity newsletter or otherwise registered with the site. If you do not agree to these terms and all applicable additional terms, then you have no right to access or use any of the services.

5.1 Fees
Fees for certain Services are set forth on the Site or via the service panel in the Software (the “Service Panel”).  Unity may increase, modify or add new fees and charges for any of the Services from time to time by posting such changes to the Site or within the Services Panel.  Unity will provide you with at least 30 days’ notice of any changes affecting existing Software and/or Developer Services you have already started using, and your continued use of such Software and/or Developer Service after the effective date of any such change means that you accept and agree to such changes, as applicable.

You agree to pay all amounts due for the Services as set forth in the online cart, quote or invoice and in accordance with Unity's payment terms and, if applicable, those of any payment processor. If any payment is not made on time, Unity may deactivate your access to the Services.  

Payments made under the Agreement shall be made without deduction or set-off for any withholding taxes, levies, imports, duties, charges and/or fees imposed by any governmental taxing authority except as required by law. If you are compelled to make any such deduction, you will pay to Unity such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure Unity's receipt of the full amount that Unity would have received but for the deduction. You will be responsible for, and agree to promptly pay, all taxes or duties of any kind (including but not limited to sales, use and withholding taxes) associated with any purchase or your receipt or use of the Services, except for taxes based on Unity’s net income.  In the event that Unity is required to collect any tax for which you are responsible, you will pay such tax directly to Unity or its payment processor.  Unity reserves the right to collect any applicable sales, use or value added tax.

All sales are final and there shall be no refunds except as required by law. Further, Unity will not allow changes to your purchase after you complete it. Unity may disable all copies of the Software and/or your access to any Services you have licensed or subscribed to in the event you fail to make all payments when due.

You acknowledge and agree that, in the case of certain Services, any estimates of fees and charges provided to you by Unity (whether based on assumed data consumption or otherwise) are solely estimates based on assumptions and that you are fully responsible for the actual fees and charges that accrue.

5.2 Billing
If you purchase Services, you will be asked to provide customary billing information, such as name, company name, billing address, credit card information, and VAT or GST number, either to Unity or its third party payment processor. VAT and GST numbers cannot be added or changed after the purchase is completed. When you provide billing information to Unity or its third party payment processor, you: (i) represent and warrant that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with such billing information; (ii) agree to pay Unity for all purchases (including all applicable taxes) made via the Site or Services Panel; and (iii) thereby authorize Unity or its third party payment processor to charge your credit card or otherwise process your payment for any purchase, subscription or other fees incurred by you. If you are directed to Unity’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s privacy policy. Please review such third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policy before using such services.

5.3 Subscription Terms
Any subscriptions you purchase will remain in effect for the initial subscription period, and thereafter will automatically renew on a month-to-month basis at the then-current list price, unless you renew the subscription for a new subscription term or terminate and cancel it as described on the Site.

6. Compliance
To ensure compliance with the Agreement, you agree that within ten (10) days from the date of Unity or its authorized representative’s request, you shall provide all pertinent records and information requested in order to verify that your installation and use of any and all Services is in compliance with the Agreement along with a signed verification that all such information is complete and correct. Furthermore, if you are a Legal Entity, Unity or its authorized representatives may upon reasonable prior notice access and inspect your facilities and computer systems to review and verify your compliance with the Agreement.  Any such inspection shall be conducted during regular business hours at your facilities or electronically via remote access. In the event you have impermissibly used Unity Personal (or other products) or have not paid the applicable fees for all Services you have deployed or used, you agree to immediately pay for such Services, as well as the reasonable inspection costs, upon Unity’s demand.

7. Termination And Account Cancellation  
Unity will have the right in its sole discretion, and without prior notice to you, to suspend or disable your Unity Account or terminate the Agreement and/or your right or ability to access or use any of the Services if: (a) you breach this Agreement; (b) your use of the Services poses a security risk to, or otherwise adversely impacts, the Services or any third party; (c) your use of the Services subjects Unity, our affiliates or any third party to liability; (d) your use of the Services may be fraudulent; (e) you have ceased to operate in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of your assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding.

In the event of any suspension, disablement or termination, you acknowledge that: (i) Unity will have no further obligation to provide the Services to you; (ii) all rights granted to you under the Agreement will immediately cease; (iii) you may no longer access any of Your Content that was previously submitted via any of the Services or that was related to your Unity Account, and Unity will have no obligation to maintain or forward you Your Content; and (iv) you will remain liable for all fees and charges for all Services ordered.  If Unity suspends, disables or terminates due to your breach, you will also remain liable for any remaining amounts owing for the entire term of your subscriptions. Any suspension, disablement or termination will not affect your obligations to Unity (including, without limitation, proprietary rights and ownership, indemnification and limitation of liability), which by their sense and context are intended to survive such suspension, disablement or termination.

THE SERVICES ARE ALL PROVIDED BY UNITY ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND. UNITY AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT THE SERVICES, OR ANY PART THEREOF, WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Unity, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) your access to or use of any of the Services; (ii) Your Content; or (iii) your violation of the Agreement or any other agreement/license with Unity.

10. Limitation Of Liability
UNITY AND ITS LICENSORS’ TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY RELATED TO THE SERVICES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU IN THE MOST RECENT THREE (3) MONTHS FOR USE OF THE SERVICES; OR (B) ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS  (US$100). IN NO EVENT WILL UNITY, ITS LICENSORS OR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS, PROFITS, GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE, SYSTEM FAILURE OR ABILITY TO EXECUTE) OR FOR THE COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGREEMENT OR THE EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, OR FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, COMMUNITIES OR WEBSITE CONTENT, OR FROM ANY COMMUNICATIONS, INTERACTIONS OR MEETINGS WITH OTHERS AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SITE, SERVICES OR COMMUNITIES, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT UNITY OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

11. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction
11.1 Choice Of Law 
The Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Denmark, without regard to or application of conflict of laws rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.

11.2 Arbitration  
Except as set forth below in Section 11.3, any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Agreement, including any disputes regarding the existence, validity or termination thereof, shall be settled by arbitration. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes by simplified arbitration arranged by The Danish Institute of Arbitration in accordance with the rules of simplified arbitration procedure adopted by The Danish Institute of Arbitration and in force at the time when such proceedings are commenced. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You and unity agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

11.3 Arbitration Exceptions
Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in court: (a) to enforce its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights), including without limitation to seek injunctive relief; (b) in cases that do not involve intellectual property rights, to seek temporary, preliminary or other expedited or provisional injunctive relief (but not money damages); or (c) collect fees due pursuant to the Agreement.

The parties agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.

The English language version of the Agreement is legally binding in case of any inconsistencies between the English version and any translations. Any terms or conditions contained in your purchase order or other ordering document that are inconsistent with or in addition to the terms and conditions of the Agreement are hereby rejected by Unity and will be deemed null. You may not assign or transfer the Agreement or any rights granted hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without Unity’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to do so, without such consent, will be void. Unity may assign or transfer the Agreement, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Unity may assign your User account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue claims limited to the collection of past due and owing amount and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the Agreement in any court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. The failure by either party to enforce any provision of the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any waiver, modification or amendment of any provision of the Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties. If any provision of the Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect.

Last Updated: May 24, 2018

1. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
These FAQs provide a handy entry point to our longer and more comprehensive Privacy Policy (see Section 2 below). They are intended to enhance rather than replace the important notices in the Privacy Policy, which governs our collection, use, storage, and sharing of the information that we collect or receive from you.

What's new as of May 25, 2018?
In these new FAQs, we provide more examples of how we may use some of the data we collect. They enhance our prior explanations but are not intended to imply that these are new uses of collected data. Additionally, if your data indicates you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), we have added information regarding new opt-out capabilities enabled for in-game advertising, and information on how you can exercise your data access and deletion (erasure) rights. Over the next few months, we will introduce the following “Data Privacy” icon to our ads, dashboards, and other points of interaction:



 

This icon will show you where you can review your data and exercise your privacy choices. It is meant as a helpful access point for viewing your personal data in the context of its use within Unity systems. For those playing games where Unity ads appear, you may see the icon instead of the traditional information (“”) button. For those using our software to build games, you may see it in a privacy dashboard.

I am a game developer that uses Unity software to build my game, what should I know?
You can access and update your information by logging into your Unity account on our website. We use analytics services to understand how developers use our software in order to improve our software and services. We also include certain device data collection in the runtime of the software, which is incorporated into the applications you create with the software. You should be sure that your privacy policy explains to your players the variety of technical information that is collected and shared with third parties like Unity. If you use Unity developer services such as Mobile Advertising and Analytics, read the applicable FAQs below and our Cookie Policy.

I visit the Unity website, what should I know?
We collect log info, including IP address and device data, related to your visits to our site. When you post comments on our community pages and forums, other forum users will be able to see your username, photo and comments. When you post, you should assume that all the information you provide is public.

I play a game built with Unity software, what should I know?
Unity has collected some or all of the following information about your device: unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFV for iOS devices and Android ID for Android devices); IP address; country of install (mapped from IP address); device manufacturer and model platform type (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, etc.) and the operating system and version running on your system or device; language; CPU information such as model, the number of CPUs present, frequency, and instruction set support flags; the graphics card type and vendor name; graphics card driver name and version (e.g., “nv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71”); which graphics API is in use (e.g., “OpenGL 2.1” or “Direct3D 9.0c”); amount of system and video RAM present; current screen resolution; version of the Unity Editor used to create the game; sensor flags (e.g., device support for gyroscope, touch pressure or accelerometer); application or bundle identification (“app ID”) of the game installed; unique advertising identifiers provided for iOS and Android devices (e.g., IDFA or Android Ad ID); and a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it transmitted correctly.

Some Unity developers use Unity’s Analytics and Ad services, which collect additional information (see FAQs on Unity Analytics and Unity Ads below for details); however, our usage of this data is largely for the following purposes. In serving ads, we try to predict which ads will be of most interest to you based on the games you play and the ads you watch. For analytics, we assist our developers to deliver the best game experience for you. For example, game developers who use our software often standardize certain features to enhance game player experience, such as saving your place in a game. This means that the game level you reached in your last session is where you will begin when you return to the game. Developers also need our assistance in tracking when you are eligible to redeem a reward within a game, such as when you have completed a challenge and get store credits to purchase new tools to play the game.  In our analytics service, some of your data points will also be rolled up into an anonymized, aggregated format to help game developers make decisions about how they support their games. For example, if a game developer is considering phasing out support for an older version of iOS software, they may look at the total number of players currently using that version of iOS software to determine if they need to support that version in updates.  Another use on a per game basis is when a developer analyzes the numbers of players dropping out after a certain level.  The developer would use this information to look at the design of their game and re-assess if the game challenge is truly intuitive or needs some additional instruction for players.  This allows the developer to enhance the experience and retain the developer’s customers better.

I play a game that uses Unity Analytics, what do I need to know?
Unity has collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, as well as events completed or actions taken within the game, including level, number of credits, time it took you to earn them, metadata about in-game communications and the value and details of purchases. Using our systems, the developer of the game has ongoing access to this data. This collection and use of data makes it possible for your experience to operate as expected by permitting you to do things like redeem rewards you have earned or return to where you left off in a game. Other Unity customers may have access to aggregated reports about game activity in general across a number of games. These reports are based, in part, on your game activities, but do not specifically identify you or your device. The reports described in this paragraph help developers make decisions on optimal methods to run the games they have made for you. For example, the developer may need to know the types of devices running the game to determine how to support game updates on an ongoing basis. Some data collected by Unity Analytics may be used by Unity Ads for personalized advertising; see the FAQs related to advertising for more information.

I received an ad from Unity Ads, what do I need to know?
Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, and information regarding the delivery of ads and your interaction with them, all of which may be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies. For clarity, Unity collects the following data: whether you click or tap an ad for a new game, whether you watch the ad or play a game frequently, whether others playing a game like the one you’re playing have downloaded a particular new game, and whether you download and install the new game you see advertised. All of this is for purposes of predicting the types of new games that you might like to download. Unity may track additional data about you in the future for purposes of making these types of predictions, and we will notify you prior to new data collection.

Do I have any choices regarding the data collection described above if I do not wish to see personalized ads?
If you are in the EU and do not wish to be targeted in this manner, the first Unity ad you see in an app (as of May 25, 2018) explains how you can opt-out of data collection in that particular game. You can opt-out then or at any time by clicking or tapping the “” button (or Data Privacy icon) on any ad you see (the “” button or Data Privacy icon will also allow you to access the data that is collected about you in that particular app). For example, you might see a summary   that includes information indicating that  we see that you are using an iPhone 8 and you are playing from Germany. In the past week we’ve seen you 5 times in this game and have shown you 27 ads. You have installed 0 games based on those ads.

(Additionally, all users, regardless of their location, may opt-out of all personalized advertising by enabling privacy features on their devices such as Limit Ad Tracking (iOS) and Opt Out of Ads Personalization (Android). See your device’s Help system for more information.)

Also, you may see certain “brand” advertising within our ad network (a brand ad is advertising for products that are not games, such as ads for an airline travel deal or a soft drink). Unity gets these ads from third-party networks. We do not permit these third parties to add your app usage to their marketing database, except for a few exceptions, which we specifically list in the Advertising Choices section of our Privacy Policy. The small subset of third parties listed are clearly noted as being permitted by our contracts to use the fact that you play a particular game in their future targeting of ads to you for other non-Unity parties.  The remaining parties listed have been clearly noted as not permitted to maintain data about the ad they served you through the Unity network for future use.  Please note that if you have told Unity not to target you or you have exercised choices directly with these third parties as described in our Advertising Choices section, this information will not be maintained or used by us or these third parties. Please note that if you have elected to not have your data collected by Unity, we do not send your advertising identifier to any third party, and you will receive only contextual advertising inside our network. You may also visit the third parties listed in our Privacy Policy (at the links we provide) to see the types of data that these parties have about you based on your device’s advertising identifier. Please review the section “What are my privacy choices for advertising?” below to learn more about how to exercise choice with regard to personalized ads.

I play a game that uses Unity Multiplayer, what do I need to know?
Unity has collected unique device identifiers, IP address (which may be matched to identify approximate location for matchmaking), as well as information regarding games played and match attributes.

What are device identifiers (like IDFA or fingerprints) and why do you collect them?
Like many other providers of mobile apps, instead of requiring users to create an account and log in to it each time they access one of our apps, Unity and others using our products may opt to recognize the user’s device through various device identifiers. Device identifiers are also used for functions that require Unity to recognize devices across various apps.

I use Unity’s game replay service (Everyplay), what do I need to know?
A: Unity has probably collected unique device identifiers and your IP address as well as your activity within the service. If you have created an account with Unity’s game replay service, Unity has received any information you actively provided when setting up your account, including email address and username. Our primary use of your data will be provision of the game replay platform and all its features, including analysis and improvement. You can access and update your account info by visiting Everyplay and navigating to the user settings page. Also:

When you create an account or profile your username, profile photo, cover photo, user description, users that you follow and users that follow you will all be public, which means that anyone can see that information and we, as well as others, may share it.

Replays that are set to public will be viewable by anyone AND the service or the relevant Developer may use the replay to promote the service or the relevant game.

When you comment on, share or like a replay using the Unity game replay platform, your replay, including any audio or video narration you attached to the replay, like or comments will be visible to others.

When you share a replay on a social network - depending on your privacy settings on that social network, some users of that social network will see the replay.

I sell assets in the Unity Asset Store. What do I need to know?
Unity has collected information about your device, including IP address, and your use of the Asset Store as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account. Our primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your placement of assets in the store and to ensure that you are paid in accordance with our agreement. Other uses might include sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store. You can access and update your account info by logging in to the Asset Store and visiting the Publisher Administration page. Also, when you publish or provide assets for licenses on the Asset Store, your seller name and other information in your Publisher profile will be visible.

I bought an asset in the Unity Asset Store. What should I know?
Unity has collected information about your device, including IP address, and your use of the Asset Store as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account. Our primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your access to the Asset Store and any assets you have purchased as well as to assure our developers selling assets on the Asset Store that we are effectively providing them due compensation.

Other uses of this information might include sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store. You can access and update your account info by logging in to the Asset Store and visiting your My Account page. You can also adjust your settings to limit the types of marketing materials we send you or to remove your consent for receiving any advertising from Unity.

2. Privacy Policy Overview

8. Your Choices About Unity’s Collection and Use of Your Information

You always have the option to refrain from using the Service or to discontinue using the Service if you do not want information collected about you.
You can choose to use the Service in a manner that limits the data we collect. For example, in Unity’s game replay Service (Everyplay) you can create an account but choose not to provide a photo.
You can access and update your information as described in the section “7. Accessing/Updating Your Information."
You can opt out of communications like email, by following the instructions in any marketing message you receive. However,

We reserve the right to send a message confirming your opt-out, whether it applies to email or SMS messages; and

Users who opt-out of marketing messages may still receive administrative, relationship, or transactional messages (e.g., we might send a notice about changes to our Terms of Service or changes to the functionality of a product or Service).

Unity Ads opt-out: You cannot opt-out of receiving ads in games or apps using Unity Ads, but you can take steps to opt-out of certain personalized ads, including within the ad unit, by clicking or tapping the “” button or the Data Privacy icon.

Please note that if you are not in the European Economic Area (EEA), your app publisher may have chosen to only apply the opt-out to those players in Europe and other countries with similar privacy laws. If that is the case, you may opt-out of all tracking by following the instructions in our Advertising Choices section or see our Cookie Policy for more information on your choices for tracking and targeting of ads in apps on mobile devices and the options available to you.

Analytics opt-out: Unity Analytics offers an opt-out to Users of Developer apps to the extent the data collected may be used for targeting purposes and assisting Unity Ads in delivery of its Services. If you do not want your information collected by Unity Analytics for other purposes described herein, such as crash reporting or helping you save your place in the game, you may have to stop using the game or application utilizing Unity Analytics.

Multiplayer opt-out: Unity Multiplayer does not currently offer an opt-out to Users of Developer apps. If you do not want your information collected by Unity Multiplayer, you may have to stop using the multiplayer features in the game or application utilizing Unity Multiplayer.
We use Google Analytics to understand how our sites are used and to improve experiences within the Service. If you want to know more about how Google Analytics works or to exercise choice in regard to the data collected by it, please visit http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. In order to control the collection of data for analytical purposes by Google, you can install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-On. Please note that we can use our own logging and tracking to understand use of our sites that do not make use of Google Analytics, and your use of their browser add-on will not impact that tracking.

We use Twitter’s ad platform to bring you more useful and interesting advertising content. If you are on the web, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) consumer choice tool at optout.aboutads.info to opt out of interest-based advertising from Twitter in your current browser. On your mobile device, enable the Limit Ad Tracking setting in your iOS phone’s settings, or the Opt Out of Ads Personalization setting in your Android phone’s settings.

Account Deletion: Everyplay Users can request an account deletion from the User Settings page in their account. Any User may contact DPO@unity3d.com to delete their Unity Account. Deleting your Unity Account does not relieve you of the obligation to pay any remaining amounts owed for your subscription(s).

9. Transfers out of Country of Collection
Unity has implemented and maintains a framework consistent with applicable law for transfers of data outside of the country of collection, including for transfers out of the EEA.
Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Services you understand that your information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.  In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE EEA: Some of the non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available at:  https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en). For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we have put in place adequate measures, such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission to protect your Personal Information. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contacting DPO@unity3d.com.
We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. 
10. Safeguards
We employ a variety of measures to safeguard the collection, transmission, and storage of the information we collect. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process, and store, and the current state of technology. Please note that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information.

11. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change our practices and this policy at any time. We may also send an email or provide notice within some or all of our offerings when this policy changes. We encourage you to check this page regularly so that you know what our current practices are.

12. California Privacy Rights
Sharing with third parties for direct marketing purposes: California residents have the right to request the identity of any third parties to whom the resident’s personal information was shared, if such sharing was to enable the third party’s direct marketing efforts. If you are a California resident and wish to make such a request, please submit your request to DPO@unity3d.com OR to opt-out of having your personal information shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please email us at DPO@unity3d.com.
How we respond to “Do Not Track” signals: We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide information in our Cookie Policy about how to prevent the delivery of targeted ads, and information in this policy about how to prevent Google Analytics and Twitter from collecting information. We do not, however, recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations, and solutions. To learn more about Do Not Track signals, you can visit allaboutdnt.com.
13. Links to Sites and Service Operated by Others
The Unity Service may contain links to other sites, applications, and services.

15. Cookie Policy
What are cookies?
Cookies are pieces of data that sites and services you use or visit can set on your browser or device and they can typically be read on future visits to learn more about the User and to personalize an experience, including the ads that are displayed to the User. “Cookies” is also a term that may be used to refer to a range of technologies that help an operator identify Users and devices, which in turn can help personalize an experience, prevent fraud, store preferences, and speed up delivery of content.

How does Unity use cookies?
Unity may employ cookies and related technologies described below for a variety of purposes, including:

To learn more about how our products and Services are used and similar analytical purposes;
To understand how Users interact with our ads;
To understand how to improve performance;
To prevent fraud;
To customize our products and Services with more relevant content; and
To provide you with more relevant advertising.
For example, we might use a web beacon to learn whether an email message was opened or we might store preferences in a Flash cookie (see below for more information).

What types of cookies and other technologies does Unity use?
As described below, Unity employs a number of technologies to provide and improve the Service. When you use the Service, you consent to our use of these technologies, but you are welcome to exercise the choices described below.

Browser cookies: Unity uses browser cookies. Most major browser companies offer tools or settings for Users who do not want cookies set or read on their devices. Please visit your browser’s settings or privacy settings pages.
Local shared objects: Unity may use local shared objects (also known as Flash cookies) on its sites. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe Flash Player website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.
Beacons, pixel tags, clear GIFs: Unity or its service providers or third parties advertising within the Service may use these technologies to learn the online behavior and interests of Users and to personalize ads that Users see. To learn more about behavioral advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) website.
Device IDs and digital fingerprinting: The Service may use one or more of a variety of unique identifiers to recognize users and their devices, including MAC address, IDFA, Android Ad ID, and digital fingerprint, which may be comprised of several types of data, including device name, the app list or applications installed on the device, and browser characteristics.

NOTE: Unity may also generate and assign a user ID when you access or use one of its Services.

What are my privacy choices for advertising?
Advertising helps to defray certain costs of providing Services, especially costs that are incurred by Unity but not recovered from Users. Thus, you may not have a choice to prevent advertisements from being presented when using the Services; however, you do have choices to limit personalized advertisements that are tailored to your interests.

If Unity delivers personalized advertising, Unity will provide notice and information about how you may be able to opt-out of such personalized advertisements. Such opportunity to opt out may occur through your device settings (see the section “Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devices” below) and the choices available within the ad unit as described in this policy by accessing the “” button or Data Privacy icon in the ad unit.

Developers may use other third-party advertising networks, and Unity’s choice features within its ad units only apply to ads delivered in the Unity network. If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by third parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA). Where applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at the NAI website, the DAA website, or the EIDAA website. Unity does not control these third-party-provided opt-out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

Unity uses Google to provide advertising through the Services and on third-party websites. We may use the following features based on Google Analytics for Display Advertising: Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. To opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.

More choices regarding browser cookies and beacons and other tracking technologies

There are several browser plugins available to Users who want to be better informed about and have more control over the use of cookies and related technologies on their devices. Some popular ones are Ghostery and Abine.

Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devices
As of the effective date of this policy, Apple and Google offered the owners of devices that use their operating systems (iOS and Android) with options for limiting tracking and targeting in relation to ads. Unity does not control your device-level opt-out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make through such a mechanism or for the continued availability, accuracy, effectiveness, or location of that mechanism. Using a device-level opt-out mechanism may opt you out of all third-party personalized advertisements, not just those delivered by Unity.
If you use an Apple device, go here.
If you use an Android device, navigate to the Google Settings page, select Ads and then choose to reset your Android Ad ID or opt-out of personalized ads.
To learn about options for many mobile ad networks, go here.

Asset Store End User License Agreement
1. Parties to the Agreement/The Subject Matter of the Agreement:
1.1
This Unity Asset Store End User License Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “EULA”) is a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement between any individual or a single entity (“END-USER”) that acquires an Asset from the Unity Asset Store and either (i) Unity Technologies ApS (company no. 30 71 99 13), Lovstraede 5, DK-1152 Copenhagen K, Denmark (“Licensor” or "Unity"), or as the case may be (ii) any third party (“Provider”) that distributes its Assets from the Unity Asset Store. Consequently, this EULA shall apply regardless of whether a purchased Asset is produced by Unity or by a Provider ("Licensor"). This EULA is therefore a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement as the case may be between either (i) Unity and END-User (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Unity), or (ii) Provider and End User (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Provider).

1.2
By installing, copying, accessing, downloading or otherwise using the Assets, End User agrees to be bound the provisions of this EULA. All definitions of the Terms shall also apply in this EULA unless the context clearly provides for a different understanding.

1.3
The subject matter of this EULA is the licensing to END-USER of any Asset acquired by End User from the Unity Asset Store. The Assets are licensed, not sold.

1.4
END USER hereby acknowledges that in the event it acquires an ASSET which in the Unity Asset Store is marked as an Asset which is distributed by Provider (as opposed to Unity), then Provider shall be considered as Licensor of such Asset and, consequently, only Provider (as opposed to Unity) shall be responsible for any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by Provider, including (without limitation) liability for infringement of any intellectual property rights, irrespective of the fact that payment takes place to Unity.

2. END-USER's Rights and Obligations
2.1
END-USER may use the licensed Assets only for their intended purpose.

2.2
2.2.1 Non-Restricted Assets. The following concerns only Assets that are not Restricted Assets: Licensor grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset to integrate Assets only as incorporated and embedded components of electronic games and interactive media and distribute such electronic game and interactive media. Except for game services software development kits (“Services SDKs”), END-USERS may modify Assets. END-USER may otherwise not reproduce, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease or lend the Assets. It is emphasized that the END-USERS shall not be entitled to distribute or transfer in any way (including, without, limitation by way of sublicense) the Assets in any other way than as integrated components of electronic games and interactive media. Without limitation of the foregoing it is emphasized that END-USER shall not be entitled to share the costs related to purchasing an Asset and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Asset (forum pooling).

2.2.2 Restricted Assets. The following concerns only Restricted Assets: Restricted Assets have license terms different from other Assets. Those license terms are found in the materials accompanying Restricted Assets ("Restricted Asset Terms"). For clarity, to the extent Restricted Asset Terms are different from this EULA, the Restricted Asset Terms will control; otherwise, this EULA will continue to apply. No other use is licensed or permitted and END-USER may otherwise not use, reproduce, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease or lend Restricted Assets. Without limitation of the foregoing it is emphasized that END-USER shall not be entitled to share the costs related to purchasing a Restricted Asset and then let any third party that has contributed to such purchase use such Restricted Asset (forum pooling).

Consequently, any Asset may only be used at particular Site or on computers assigned to END-USER's employees employed at the same Site and may only be moved to another Site subject to prior written approval from Licensor. THIS CLAUSE 2.3 DOES NOT APPLY TO ASSETS THAT IN THE UNITY ASSET STORE ARE CATEGORIZED UNDER THE HEADING "EDITOR EXTENSIONS."

2.4
Editor Extensions: END-USER is granted a license to install and use any Assets which are categorized in the Asset Store as "Editor Extensions" only on one (1) computer. For the avoidance of doubt, Editor Extension Assets are licensed on a per computer basis may not be shared or used concurrently on different computers.

END-USER shall pay for the license to the Assets in accordance with the payment process provided in the Asset Store. END USER shall provide customary billing and tax information such as name, billing address, credit card information and VAT number (for EU residents). END USER agrees to pay for all purchases hereby authorizes the collection of such amounts including applicable taxes by charging the credit card provided, either directly by Unity or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor. VAT numbers cannot be added or changed after the purchase is completed. If you are directed to a third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s Privacy Policy. Please review such third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. All sales are final and there shall be no refunds except as required by law.

2.7
Some components of Assets (whether developed by Unity or third parties) may also be governed by applicable open source software licenses. In the event of a conflict between the applicable EULA and any such open source licenses, the open source software licenses shall prevail with respect to those components.

2.8

In order to use the Unity Asset Store to distribute Assets, Provider must first agree to this Agreement by checking the box indicating Provider’s acceptance of this Agreement prior to distributing Assets on the Unity Asset Store.

Any person who enters into this Agreement on behalf of Provider represents and warrants that they have full legal authority to bind Provider.

Provider also agrees that the handling of personal data in relationship to the distribution of its assets on the Unity Asset Store is governed by the Controller-Controller Asset Store Addendum found here.

4. Pricing and Payments
4.1
This Agreement covers both Assets that Provider chooses to distribute for free and Assets for which Provider charges a fee. All fees for Assets distributed via the Unity Asset Store must be processed by the Payment Processor.

4.2
Provider may set the price for Provider's Assets in US Dollars (USD). For practical purposes all prices shall be fixed by Provider at full USD amounts. (For example prices set at 5.99 USD may not be applied). The Unity Asset Store may display to Customers the price of Provider's Assets in USD or other currencies that Unity may consider expedient. Unity may choose to set different prices in other currencies, and shall not be responsible for the accuracy of the prices set, or for currency and conversion rates.

4.3
The prices that Provider sets for Assets or the prices that Unity sets in other currencies than USD (cf. clause 4.2), whichever is applicable, will determine the amount of payment Provider will receive. 70 (seventy) percent of the sales price (less any refunds, bank fees related to the transfer to the Provider and less any taxes, levies and VAT or the like) will be remitted by Unity to the Provider. The remaining 30 (thirty) percent will be allotted to and retained by Unity.

4.3.1
PayPal Accounts Paid Monthly. The parties agree that any balance in favor of Provider will be calculated by Unity and made available to Provider via a web page.

Check or Wire Payments Paid Quarterly. If Provider fails to provide a valid PayPal account, Unity will pay balances above USD 250 to Provider on a quarterly basis by check or wire payment, less applicable bank fees. However, any such account balance in favor in of Provider of less than 250 USD at the end of a calendar quarter will not be paid. Instead, such balance below 250 USD will be carried forward to the following calendar quarter. In the event that the balance for a period of eight consecutive calendar quarters remains below 250 USD, then Unity will pay such balance to Provider, less any bank fees related to the transfer to the Provider. The current applicable bank fees for check or wire payments are set forth in the Asset Store.

4.3.3
Notwithstanding anything else herein, if Provider is an individual and resident in Denmark, provision to Unity of Provider's tax identification number registered with the Danish Central Business Register ("CVR Number") shall be a condition precedent to any payment obligation of Unity's under this Agreement; for greater certainty, (a) unless and until Unity is provided with the Provider's CVR Number, Unity is under no obligation to make any payment to the Provider; and (b) upon being provided with the CVR Number, accrued amounts will become payable hereunder, but no interest will be payable on those amounts.

4.4
Provider is solely responsible for payment of any taxes, levies and VAT or the like on any payments it receives from Unity regardless of which taxing jurisdiction that has the authority to collect such taxes, levies and VAT or the like.

4.5
Provider may also choose to distribute Assets for free. If the Asset is free, Unity shall not be entitled to receive the 30 (thirty) per cent listed in Section 4.3 above. Provider may not in the future collect charges from Customers for copies of the Assets that those Customers previously downloaded for free.

4.7 Provider Support
4.7.1
Provider will be solely responsible for support and maintenance of Provider's Assets and any complaints about Provider's Assets. Provider's contact information will be displayed in each Asset detail page and made available to Customers for customer support purposes.

4.7.2
Failure to provide adequate support for Provider's Assets may result in low Asset ratings, less prominent Asset exposure, low sales and billing disputes. In the event of disputes for Assets sold for less than 50 USD, Unity may at Provider's expense decide that the full purchase price shall be refunded to the Customer and charged back in full to the Provider, in addition to any handling fees charged by the Payment Processor. Chargeback requests for Assets sold at 50 USD or more will be handled in accordance with the Payment Processor's standard policy.

4.8 Reinstalls
4.8.1
Provider acknowledges and agrees that Customers that have licensed an Asset will have the ability to access and download the Asset for as long as the Asset is available on the Asset Store. Customer’s use of the Asset shall remain subject to the EULA.

APPENDIX 1 - UNITY ASSET STORE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
1. Parties to the Agreement/ The Subject Matter of the Agreement:
1.1
This Unity Asset Store End User License Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “EULA”) is a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement between any individual or a single entity (“END-USER”) that acquires an Asset from the Unity Asset Store and either (i) Unity Technologies APS (company no. 30 71 99 13), Lovstraede 5, DK-1152 Copenhagen K, Denmark (“Licensor” or "Unity"), or as the case may be (ii) any third party (“Provider”) that distributes its Assets from the Unity Asset Store. Consequently, this EULA shall apply regardless of whether a purchased Asset is produced by Unity or by a Provider ("Licensor"). This EULA is therefore a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement as the case may be between either (i) Unity and END-User (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Unity), or (ii) Provider and End User (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Provider).

1.2
By installing, copying, accessing, downloading or otherwise using the Assets, End User agrees to be bound the provisions of this EULA. All definitions of the Terms shall also apply in this EULA unless the context clearly provides for a different understanding.

1.3
The subject matter of this EULA is the licensing to END-USER of any Asset acquired by End User from the Unity Asset Store. The Assets are licensed, not sold.

1.4
END USER hereby acknowledges that in the event it acquires an ASSET which in the Unity Asset Store is marked as an Asset which is distributed by Provider (as opposed to Unity), then Provider shall be considered as Licensor of such Asset and, consequently, only Provider (as opposed to Unity) shall be responsible for any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by Provider, including (without limitation) liability for infringement of any intellectual property rights, irrespective of the fact that payment takes place to Unity.

2. END-USER's Rights and Obligations

Unity Statement on GDPR Readiness
On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will become effective in the European Economic Area (EEA). This new regulation builds on the data privacy regulations in place in the EEA since 1995. The GDPR provides specific protections for individuals in Europe on how their data may be collected, moved, stored and processed.

Last Updated: June 5, 2018.

Unity Games and Data Collection
Unity is committed to the responsible collection and use of player data – and enhancing privacy safeguards. As such, if you are a developer or publisher that uses Unity Ads, Unity Analytics or any other Unity service, you can be confident that Unity is committed to GDPR compliance and will assist you with your technical preparations, including collaborating with your privacy and legal teams, so that you are aware of, and have confidence in, our GDPR implementation.

If you are a player of games made with Unity, or if you see ads in other games that are served by the Unity Ads SDK, we currently collect gameplay and device data. This data allows game developers and publishers to tune their games for player devices and to serve players with relevant advertisements about other games, movies and/or products that may interest them. These ads enable the developers and publishers to offer free-to-play games.

With the GDPR – and to be transparent about the data we collect and how it is used – we will be providing players with a data privacy option. On a game-by-game basis, players will be able to opt-out of data collection. As well, they will have access to Unity’s Privacy Policy (to be updated for the GDPR by May 25, 2018), and will be able to change their privacy setting any time they see an ad. Players who opt-out of data collection will still see ads, but these ads will be random and not tailored for the player.

Frequently Asked Questions
To clearly explain how Unity will comply with the GDPR – and how this will impact developers, publishers, and players – we have provided answers to common questions. We will update the FAQ as necessary. Contact us at GDPR@unity3d.com if you have questions not covered below.

General Information
What kind of player data does Unity collect and what does Unity use it for?
If a game developer or publisher enables Unity Ads or Unity Analytics for their game, we collect data such as device type, country, device language, in-game behavior and purchases, IP address, Apple’s Advertising Identifier (IDFA), and Google Play advertising ID. This information helps developers and publishers tailor games and ads for players and their devices, such as providing ads designed for specific device types, player languages, and game preferences.

Why provide advertising at all?
A great deal of creativity and resources go into making all games. Developers and publishers can provide free-to-play games because advertising helps cover their costs. As such, Unity tailors ad types and frequency so players have a better experience (for example, by seeing fewer but more relevant ads). This also allows advertisers to serve the most pertinent ads to players.   

Does Unity collect what the GDPR refers to as “special categories” of personal information about players, such as political, religious, or sexual orientation?
No. Unity only collects gameplay and device information. Unity does not collect these special categories of personal information.  

What is Unity’s strategy to assure GDPR compliance on May 25, 2018?
Prior to that date, Unity Ads will provide an updated SDK (see below for more information) and an Analytics plug-in and other resources to Unity game developers and publishers so they can provide players with a simple way to learn about and set their data privacy option. Unity is also working closely with other partners to ensure they are aware of these resources and changes.

When will players be able to opt-out of data collection?
As of May 25, 2018, when a player begins playing a new free-to-play game, they will be presented with the opt-out option and a link to the Unity Privacy Policy. This will appear on the first ad they see in each game.

What will happen if a player opts-out of data collection?
On a per-game basis, the player’s data will be deleted and the player will only see random, non-targeted ads or ads based solely on contextual data.

Will players be able to opt-in or opt-out of data collection at any time?
Each time a Unity ad appears in a game, players will be able to access and change their privacy setting via the Info “” icon on the Unity ad, you could also see our "Data Privacy" icon.

Information for Developers, Publishers and Other Partners
Why does Unity have an opt-out option rather than an opt-in (consent) option via its ads?

The opt-out option is an appropriate safeguard for Unity’s processing of data, including targeting, as long as our use of the collected data for targeting is compatible with the uses of data that are strictly necessary for our business purposes. We also have to consider whether or not we are collecting what the GDPR refers to as “special categories” of information like race, ethnicity or sexual orientation, as collection and targeting with this type of data requires opt-in consent. Unity does not use special categories of data in its targeting or other data processing within our products.

The data we collect – such as device types, country, player languages, game preferences, and crash reports – is used to support operations, such as enhancing player experience by optimizing games for device types. Based on this legitimate business use of the data, the GDPR requires only that Unity provides players with the ability to exercise their GDPR rights, including what it calls “the right to object.”

Unity implemented the opt-out option to provide players with the ability to exercise this right and other data rights found in the GDPR. We provide the ability to exercise these rights via the Unity Ads SDK and the Unity Data Privacy Plug-In. The exercise of rights is an easy method for players to authenticate their identity, access the data we hold in the app, request Unity to stop processing (targeting) the data, and request that the data be deleted.

We recognize that some of our advertisers, publishers, partners, or developers might need a consent option for other data that they collect, and we're looking into it. We make tools for more than just ourselves and want to support everyone with whom we work.

Is the “opt-out” seen in the ads opt-out consent?

The “opt-out” that you see in the privacy dashboard is not related to consent, but rather the right to object. It gives players in special circumstances the opportunity to object to our profiling, as called for in GDPR. With legitimate interests as a legal basis for its processing, Unity does not require consent. Here’s how that breaks down:

Other ad platforms are only an SDK, meaning they only profile for the purpose of advertising. This kind of in-game advertising (without any additional purpose) requires opt-in consent as its legal basis.

Unity is SDKs, it’s plugins, and it’s the engine itself. So, Unity’s profiling is compatible with other, more legitimate interests than merely ads. Crash reports, bug fixes, enabling user-user communication, etc., are each of legitimate interest to our gamers and developers. Our profiling enables those purposes. Unity is in a unique position because our profiling is compatible to those legitimate interests.

We recognize that some of our advertisers, publishers, partners, or developers might need a consent option for other data that they collect, and we're looking into it. We make tools for more than just ourselves and want to support everyone with whom we work.

What do I need to know about HW Stats in regards to GDPR?

HW Stats collects certain identifiers that are unique to the device but are not used to track or profile users. The unique identifiers are pseudonymized and aggregated for statistical purposes (not related to profiling users).  Unity processes this data on the basis of our legitimate interest. While we have Ads and Analytics customer tools in place to allow players to exercise their GDPR rights, we want to improve and simplify that process for our HW Stats only customers and will be soon releasing a HW stats specific solution that will provide players an easier way to access their data.

Is Unity classified as a processor or a controller when processing data under the GDPR?

Unity is a processor with respect to developer data in Cloud Services, and a controller of player data that we collect via Unity Ads and Analytics.

As a developer or publisher, do I need a new Data Processing Addendum (DPA) with Unity?
Unity Legal has added an updated Processor DPA and Controller-Controller DPA. They can be found here. The GDPR page will identify which documents apply to which services. Terms and Conditions for services will be updated prior to May 25, 2018, to provide appropriate references to these addenda as well.

Will your Privacy Policy move from its current URL?
No. Our Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect certain new processes for players and the URL will remain the same. You may use the current link if you need to update your own privacy policy.

As a publisher, what should I do to be transparent with my players?
You should continue to notify your players about third-party ad partners (like Unity) that you share data with. You can do this by placing a link to our Privacy Policy within your own privacy policy. This is no different from the transparency Unity has recommended prior to the GDPR.

As a publisher, do I need to obtain consent from players about targeted advertising?
Unity will provide opt-out choices for behaviorally targeted advertising from anyone who sees a Unity ad. If you are not exclusively using Unity Ads, Unity can handle this for you through your mediation partners. Contact your Account Manager for more information. If you do not have an Account Manager, please contact support@unity3d.com.

How will Unity allow players to decide if they receive targeted ads?
Unity will provide players with the ability to opt-out of targeted advertising. The first Unity ad that a player sees in each game will provide them with information about the data we collect, a link to our Privacy Policy, and the opt-out option. Players will be able to change their privacy setting any time they see a Unity ad via the Info “” icon, you could also see our "Data Privacy" icon.

How can I let Unity know that I have obtained consent for targeted ads from my players outside of the Unity platform?
Unity will give publishers the ability to indicate that you have obtained consent from your own systems. If you would like to let Unity know that you will be obtaining consent outside Unity, please contact your Account Manager. If you do not have an Account Manager, please contact support@unity3d.com.

As a publisher, do I need to update my Unity Ads SDK?
If you are using Unity Ads SDK 2.0 or newer, GDPR-related changes will be automatically available to you no later than May 25, 2018. If you are using SDK 1.5 or older, we recommend that you update the SDK; otherwise, Unity can only serve contextual ads for your players.

What does opting-out of Unity Analytics mean for a player?
Players will be able to opt-out of Unity Analytics on a per-game basis. If a player chooses to opt-out, Unity Analytics will no longer optimize game experiences based on their in-game behaviors.

How do I make my game compliant with GDPR?

We have created tools to help your with your GDPR compliance. As such, if you are Made with Unity, we recommend you implement the Unity Data Privacy Plug-in.

How does Unity treat COPPA under GDPR?

Unity does not combine data from COPPA apps with any other apps for targeting or insights purposes.

What data does Unity Analytics collect?

Unity Analytics collects gameplay and device information from players who play games made with Unity. The only Personally Identifiable Information collected is device ID and IP address. The other data collected includes hardware specs, usage data, in-app purchase behavior, and custom event data (if applicable).

What does the Unity Data Privacy Plug-in do?

The Unity Data Privacy Plug-in will generate a link inside you game that redirects the player to a webview where they will be able to opt-out of data collection as well as delete historic data. It will also allow players to access the relevant information that has been collected about them.

How can I access and implement the Unity Data Privacy Plug-in?

The Unity Data Privacy Plug-in is available through the Asset Store. Please also view our documentation.

What versions of Unity does the Unity Data Privacy Plug-in support?

The Unity Data Privacy Plug-in supports versions:

4.7
5.2
5.6
2017.1+
2018.1+
When I implement the Unity Data Privacy Plug-in, will players need to update their app to see the link?

Yes - the Plug-in requires a new build, which means players will need to update their app.

If I have implemented the Unity Data Privacy Plug-in for one game, do I have to do so for the rest of my games?

Yes - opting out of Unity Analytics happens on a game-by-game basis.

As a player, how can I see the information a game has about me through Unity?

For any game that has implemented the Unity Data Privacy Plug-in, you will be able to click the link and then select “I would like to see my data.” This may take up to 24 hours to process.  

 

Information for Users of Developer Services
This section covers Unity Collaborate, Cloud Build, Performance Reporting, and Bug Reporting (Alpha).

General Information

In the context of Developer Services and the data it collects, Unity is a processor of data. The customer (“developer”) is the controller.

In regards to “personally identifiable information” (PII), Developer Services maintains a Name/Public User ID in the form of project history. For example, when a developer makes a change to a project, that change is recorded and communicated to other team members. To “forget” that user, Developer Services will provide functionality allowing a developer to “mask” their historical activity upon request.  

What creator data is collected by Developer Services?

Developer Services collects project-related data such as project assets, code, developer activity, and credentials, as provided by the developer to Unity.  

How is the data used?

Unity is a processor of the data, and uses the data provided by the developer (who is the controller of the data) to fulfill tasks and services that the developer chooses. For example, tasks and services include:

Project assets stored in Cloud Storage to secure files and enable Collaborate features.

Developer activity recorded by Unity to show and manage the historical state of a project in Collaborate.

Project credentials to access project assets and automatically create builds for the developer via Cloud Build.

How long is data retained?

Project data, including backups, is retained for a finite period. The retention policy varies depending on the nature of the primary service processing it. A developer can manually delete data at any time via features provided by the service, or by contacting Unity at support.unity3d.com.

In addition to using data to deliver services that the developer has opted into, Unity may also use data to identify and target individual developers to further the Unity business, including requests for product feedback and exposure to marketing materials. Developers have the ability to opt-out of these communications.  

What player data is collected by Developer Services?

Through reporting features – Performance Reporting, Bug Reporting (Alpha) – Developer Services collects error reports generated by an application made with Unity and information about the device it was collected on. Device information includes data that could be considered personal data (machine ID), but this information is anonymized before it is retained.  

In some cases, a developer may send PII to Unity inadvertently. For example, with features provided via Bug Reporting, a player could share a screenshot that includes the player’s in-game name. Unity does not identify or data-process information collected in this fashion.

How do I inquire about a GDPR-related issue concerning Developer Services?

You can create a ticket at support.unity3d.com and your request will be acknowledged and prioritized.

 

Information for Unity Developers, and Unity Profile Updates
Unity is committed to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will go into effect May 25, 2018, in the European Economic Area (EEA). Over the past year, we have been working to update your Unity Profile with the goal of streamlining how you invoke your rights under GDPR. Please note that nothing in this communication is intended to replace or supersede the Privacy Policy on our website, which governs our use of your data; however, we are providing you with a summary of changes that are coming your way by May 25 and throughout this year.

By May 25, we will provide updates to id.unity.com to offer you these new security and privacy options. With Unity Profile, new and existing users will have a seamless experience with all our services. In addition, users will also have enhanced control over the information in their profiles.

Security and privacy are areas we’re always focused on improving. In the upcoming months, we will consolidate public-facing user profiles from community services – including Unity Forums, Unity Asset Store, and Unity Answers – into Unity Connect. To be clear, you will not experience any interruption of these services nor changes to their features. Be on the lookout for more information as we progress.

Coming Soon – Unity Profile Updates
We’re making some significant updates to your Unity Profile to make it easier to access community services and to manage your privacy and information.

Easier access to all your Unity services. We’re always working on improving your experience to ensure it’s easy for you to find and access all of our services. With Unity Profile, we’re updating our global Dashboard to enable you to easily move between our various communities and services.

Enhanced control over your privacy and information. We’re making it easier for you to see relevant profile information in a central location. Unity Profile will provide you with the ability to fine-tune your privacy and security settings as well as help you control what information you want visible on your profile.

Engage with the community with a single profile. Many of our users currently have multiple public profiles on our community services. In order to make it simpler for you to update and manage your information across these profiles, we’re migrating your community profiles into a central location on Unity Connect this year.

 

Frequently Asked Questions
To understand how Unity Profile will affect your information as a Unity user, we’ve compiled the following FAQs. Contact us at DPO@unity3d.com if you have questions not covered below.

What is a Unity Profile?

A Unity Profile is your public identity within the Unity ecosystem and community. It’s how you define who you are and how others see you. With it, you’ll be able to access Unity Connect community features such as Unity Connect Groups and Messenger.

This is not to be confused with your UnityID, which is your developer user account with Unity. Your UnityID allows you to connect with your Unity teams and resources, and securely control access to Unity services for you and your team members.

Why are you doing this?

We want to ensure that users have a seamless experience with all our community services. With our improved Dashboard, you can seamlessly move among core Unity services. We also want to make sure users have more control over their privacy settings, particularly any information they share via Unity services.

What privacy settings should I expect by May 25?

All Unity creators will have access to a new privacy panel found at id.unity.com/privacy/edit. From there, you’ll be able to directly access our services that have potential privacy choices for you to make via a link to the respective service’s privacy profile settings. In the future, we will migrate these options to the UnityID privacy panel.

What security settings should I expect by May 25?

All Unity creators will have access to a new security panel found at id.unity.com/security. Here you’ll be able to manage your 2-factor authentication settings as well as see your most recent sessions beside the associated IP address.

How can I delete my UnityID?

In a new Account Management section of your UnityID, you’ll be able to delete your UnityID. This process shouldn’t be taken lightly, however, as it will remove your personal information from many of Unity’s applications and services, including content you have created in connection with your UnityID.  

Please note that Unity may keep certain information in our financial records even after your account is no longer active. Moreover, deletion is always subject to determination that there is no outstanding financial obligation to Unity or from Unity to you. To clarify, if you currently have an account balance, your account cannot be deleted.

Once again, before deleting your account, be sure to arrange to port your content to another system and resolve all open financial issues.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Once you delete your account, you will lose all access to your Unity projects, your Unity Connect Messenger logs, all your assets from the Asset Store, and all other account-related data. If you still plan on deleting your profile but want to have access to your information, we strongly recommend that you manually back up your information/data.  

What if I don’t want a Unity Connect profile?

Once your profile is migrated, you can make your profile public. Your profile will not be public by default. You can choose to leave your profile setting on private, meaning other users will not be able to see your profile and your information will not be discoverable publicly. If you would like to delete your profile, contact support@unity3d.com.

7. Acceptable Payment Forms
Summary You may need to comply with PayPal and Stripe’s acceptable use policies. You agree to pay for something when you enter your payment information. You are the authorized user of any payment information you enter.

Publishers who distribute content on the Service for a fee may be subject to the acceptable use policies of the Company’s payment providers, Stripe and PayPal. You can review the acceptable use policies for our payment providers:

PayPal
Stripe
When you provide payment information to the Company or one of its payment providers, you represent that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with that payment, and you authorize the Company to charge your credit card or process your payment with the chosen payment provider.


8. Transactions and Fees
Summary Publishers can set their own prices for their games (or even make them free). If you do sell your game, itch.io will be entitled to a share (that you set) and may be required to withhold an amount of the sales for tax, VAT and other charges.

Publishers may set the prices, at their own discretion, for their content and products to be sold through the Service (each sale, a “Transaction”). The Company shall be entitled to a share of the revenue Publishers receive from Transactions which shall be calculated on the gross revenue from the Transactions, not including any Transactions for which Publisher or Company provides a refund in accordance with the transaction configuration on Publisher’s account (the “Revenue Share”). Publishers may also configure transactions to provide for a portion of revenue to be directed towards a selected charity under the Publisher’s transaction configuration. For Transactions, Company will collect the purchase price and any applicable fees and taxes through its payment providers, and will pay to Publisher the proceeds net of the applicable Revenue Share, payment provider fees, and applicable taxes, VAT, duties, charges or levies. The Company may withhold any taxes, duties, charges or levies on payments by Company to Publisher pursuant to this Agreement, as may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation, and submit such withheld taxes, duties, charges or levies to the appropriate tax authority. Use of IP proxies or other methods to disguise your place of residence, whether to circumvent geographic restrictions on content, to purchase at a price not applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose, is a violation of this Agreement.


9. Refunds
Summary You may be eligible for a refund if the product does not work or does not represent what was advertised. Please contact support for help.

Users may request, and Company may process, refund requests if the purchased content cannot run, some other issue prevents access to the content, or the product does not accurately represent what was advertised. For technical issues, Company will direct users to the Publisher to first try to resolve such issues. To request a refund, please contact support with your purchase information. For content selling third party external keys (e.g. Steam keys), Company may require the Publisher to confirm cancellation of the key before a refund can be processed due to the Company’s inability to disable access. Some Publishers utilizing older payment methods are responsible for handling refunds themselves. If you are uncertain about refund eligibility, please contact support.

10. Unclaimed Earnings In Publisher Accounts
Summary If you don’t withdraw earnings from your account older than a year, we may charge a maintenance fee proportional to any unclaimed money older than a year left in your account. Itch.io is not a bank, so you need to claim your earnings in a timely manner. If you need Itch.io to withhold unclaimed payments longer than 12 months contact support.

Publisher accounts receiving Payouts from the Company are subject to a maintenance fee for unclaimed transactions. Payouts from the Company are issued when the Company is the Merchant of Record.

Accrued revenue from transactions initiated over twelve (12) months ago that has not been claimed for withdrawal may be subject to a maintenance fee. Company reserves the right to debit your Publisher account balance per month:

Ten percent (10%) of the original revenue earned per purchase older than twelve (12) months
until your balance reaches zero or you initiate a withdrawal for the remainder of the balance. Publisher accounts may request to delay this fee by contacting support and expressing their intent to claim at a determined time in the future.

In simple English, this means that after 1 year, if you haven’t initiated a payout for the earnings of a purchase, 10% of it will be debited from your account per month. After 10 months you will no longer be able to claim any of that purchase.

The maintenance charge will not cause your account balance to become negative and will not cause you to owe money to the Company.

Publisher accounts with purchases initiated before the publish date of this clause (May 24, 2018), have a six month grace period (until November 24, 2018) where the maintenance fee will not be applied.

11. Warranty Disclaimer
YOU AGREE THAT USE OF THE SERVICE SHALL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE COMPANY, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS (“AFFILIATES”) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND THE USE THEREOF TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

12. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR YOUR LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, YOUR ACCOUNT, OR YOUR PURCHASED/SUBMITTED CONTENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES. IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ITCH.IO, THE SERVICES, OR THE CONTENT, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF THE COMPANY’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ FAULT, TORT (EXCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR BREACH OF COMPANY’S WARRANTY AND EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS AND LIABILITY EXCLUSIONS APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE RECOMPENSE. AS SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, EACH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES’ LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

13. Term and Termination.
Summary Users can terminate their account at any time, but are not entitled to a refund because of such termination.

Certain sections of the Terms of Service relating to how the agreement is interpreted and administered will still apply, even if you terminate your account.

Term. The term of this Agreement commences on the date you first register an account and will continue in effect unless otherwise terminated in accordance with this Agreement.
Termination by Users. Users may terminate their account at any time. You may cease to use your account, or if you so choose, may request that the Company terminate your access to your account.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.
Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 – Scope.

License grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.

Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

Attribution.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
ShareAlike.
In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.
You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.

This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Section 8 – Interpretation.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” The text of the Creative Commons public licenses is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.

 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.
“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.
